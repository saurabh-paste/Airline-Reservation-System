# Airline-Reservation-System
The Airline Reservation System is a comprehensive project developed to check the availability of the flight tickets of a specified flight with its destination and the date of journey. If the tickets are available according to the user's needs and specification, then the software provides a facility to book the ticket.

This system aims to revolutionize the booking process, offering a convenient platform for users to manage their travel plans and elevating the standards of airline reservation services. It is a meticulously crafted solution aimed at seamlessly checking flight ticket availability for specified flights, destinations, and travel dates, enhancing the overall booking experience for users. The system ensures accuracy and reliability in availability verification. With a sleek and intuitive user interface developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React JS, users can effortlessly navigate the platform. Dual authentication mechanisms distinguish between admin and user logins, enabling efficient flight management for admins and streamlined booking for users. Supported by the robustness of Spring Boot and Hibernate, the backend infrastructure guarantees optimal performance and integration with the frontend. MySQL powers the database management, ensuring secure storage and retrieval of critical flight and user data.
